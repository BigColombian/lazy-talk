This talk is intended for python developers who are interested in learning about
an important computer science concept. Attendees should be somewhat comfortable
with Python syntax; however, they do not need to be experts. Most of the
examples will be kept simple to get out of the way of the concepts being
taught. Attendees should leave the talk with an understanding of lazy evaluation
and how it is present in the standard Python language, as well as an
understanding of how libraries can use it to build APIs.
